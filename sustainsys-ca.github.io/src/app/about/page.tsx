                        As Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (ML) has begun to influence Canadaâ€™s industrial, social, and cultural landscape, ML tasks require increasingly large and complex compute and software infrastructure with significant impact on the environmental footprint. As such, future data engineers need to think green and holistic to develop the energy-efficient data analytics platforms of tomorrow.

                        <li>
                            The trainees will learn to think green and are able to embed environmental sustainability concepts in the entire development and deployment life-cycle of data science.

                        <li>
                            The trainees will become the trainers and mentors of tomorrow so as to drive knowledge mobilization within the industry.
