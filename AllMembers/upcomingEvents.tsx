      description: "The third edition of the Data Systems meet Data Science (DSDS) workshop is organized by the CREATE SustainSys: Sutainable Data Systems for Data Science .
The workshop series brings together the research community that works at the intersection of data/software systems, software engineering, and Data Science/AI/ML, either by building the next generation Data Science platforms or by using  AI/ML techniques to improve systems. 
Being now embedded in the CREATE program, the workshop will partially focus on sustainability and energy-efficiency of the systems and platform that support or employ ML.
Technical presentations from guest speakers in industry and academia will be augmented with poster and demo sessions from students, as well as time and space for discussions.

The workshop is co-organized by Bettina Kemme, Essam Mansour, Hans-Arno Jacobsen, Natalie Enright-Jerger, Oana Balmau, Semih SalihoÄŸlu
