        As Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (ML) has begun to influence Canadaâ€™s industrial, social, and cultural landscape, ML tasks require increasingly large and complex compute and software infrastructure with significant impact on the environmental footprint. As such, future data engineers need to think green and holistic to develop the energy-efficient data analytics platforms of tomorrow.
        SustainSys, the CREATE program on Sustainable Data Systems for Data Science will train a new generation of highly-skilled computer scientists with the following objectives:
